# Audio Visualizer
This application is a customizable audio visualizer themed around the ocean. Users can select from three different songs and change some visualization parameters to experience audio visually. You can view a live version [here.](https://people.rit.edu/jrn2778/330/project2/)

### Note
This application was previously made as an academic project. I moved the code to this new repository for posterity and reference purposes. Find more of my projects at [justinnauta.com](https://justinnauta.com)

## My Role

Sole Developer (The entirety of the application was developed by me)

## Technologies

JavaScript • HTML • CSS

## Difficulties

Planning and implementing the visualization of audio proved to be a complicated task. It requires some knowledge of how sound works and the different parts of sound. Even with an understanding of sound and audio there is still the problem of how to visualize it.

## Solution

I started by learning the basics of how sound works, then investigated sound specifically in the web context. From there I was able to express the different parts of sound, such as amplitude, as percentages of a whole. I then took those percentages and applied them to scale the on-screen graphics.

## Notable Features

To have more control over functionality and design, I chose to implement my own audio controls, rather than using the browser defaults. These controls include a play/pause button, a time scrubber, a volume slider, and a song selector, all of which I designed and programmed.
